# Rules

Graphic design-based 
wide ranging 
strictly focused
Fundamental

## Rules

Only uses element selectors. Acts as a minimally desired, coherent, fundamental design starting point.
Can superficially change from project to project.
Should be established mostly at the beginning of a project. Can evolve but with great care & caution.

## Role
Casting as wide a net as possible, preventing the need for a majority of these fundamental graphic design rules further down the chain (in components, for example). Heavy lifting.

## Dimensions

Rhythm

Only margins. mostly margin-top. a little margin-left if needed. Makes ample use of universal child selectors like `>*+*`

Typography

Only font based properties. No color.
Choose a scale. Apply it on selected elements.

Color

To be determined. Still on the fence.
